## Î´18O Values as a Proxy of High Latitude Paleoclimate in Coralline Red Algae

These are the data and R scripts associated with a student project on the validity of using the coralline red alga *Sporolithon nodosum* as a high latitude climate archive.

1. Data file contains the following:
- `d18O.csv` contains d18O values from isotope analysis of carbonate samples obtained from a *S. nodosum* specimen
- `era5_sst_1940-2023.txt` and `modeledTemp.csv` contain the raw modeled SST data from specimen collection site
- `Leigh_Marine_Station_Annual_Mean_Temperature.csv` contains raw CSST data from Leigh Marine Station 
2. Scripts file contains the following:
- `d18O.R` contains all the script used to clean data, run linear regression, and create figures
